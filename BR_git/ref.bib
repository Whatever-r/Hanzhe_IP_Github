 great interest in a project that applies agent-based modeling to industrial supply networks, since virtually all
	computer-based modeling of such networks up to this point has used system dynamics, an approach based on ordinary
	differential equations (ODE's). This paper summarizes the domain of supply networks and illustrates how they can
	be modeled both with agents and with equations. It summarizes the similarities and differences of these two

@article{DEHAAN20091083,
	abstract = {In this paper, we simulate the car market in order to forecast the effects of feebate systems based on
 an energy-labeling scheme using categories A to G. Very fuel-efficient (A) cars receive a cash incentive, highly
	inefficient (G) cars pay additional fees. Consumers have different price elasticities and behavioral options to
	react to feebates. They can switch to a smaller sized car, but as energy-efficiency varies widely within size
	segments, they can also stick to the preferred size class and choose a more efficient (smaller) engine. In
	addition, previously owned cars influence the next car to be chosen. We use an agent-based microsimulation
	approach particularly suited to predict environmental and market effects of feebates. Heteorogenous agents choose
	from a choice set drawn from a detailed fleet of new cars. Incentives of €2000 for A-labeled cars induce an
	additional rated CO2 emission decrease of new car registrations between 3.4% and 4.3%, with CO2 abatement costs
	between €6 and €13 per ton, and otherwise little undesired market disturbance. The risk of rebound effects is
	estimated to be low. After adopting the frequencies of consumer segments to a given country, the model presented
	is applicable to all European car markets.},
